										"I didn't know anything about visitor studies until I started my graduate studies at the University of Washington, where I was lucky enough to work with some incredibly smart and inspiring mentors in the areas of research and evaluation. Once I learned what visitor studies was, it seemed like a "DUH!" thing to me... why wouldn't you set smart and achievable goals and then check to see if you accomplished them? I especially love the process of setting and refining goals, and consistently revisiting these throughout the process of implementing and evaluating my work. As someone who primarily works as an educator, the evaluative mindset makes me a better planner, prioritizer, and communicator. " - Julia Miller

										"I'd love to help my current museum implement evaluation and get visitor feedback as a more ingrained part of daily operation and planning. They are really interested in doing evaluation and learning more about their audiences, and I am hoping to help them set up some easy mechanisms to make feedback consistent and easy-to-use! For me personally, I want to do a lot more work with families and young children in evaluation. I especially love the challenge of working with preschoolers, and want to learn more about how to accurately capture information about what they are learning and doing in museums!" - Julia Miller

										"I work with a rather large Research and Evaluation team. We are pretty good about chatting formally and informally about interesting studies and theories. I subscribe to eNews and listervs for VSA, AEA, AAM, ASTC, artnews and UW Museology, and occasionally attend conferences and webinars hosted by those organizations. Finally, I try to talk with as many of my past colleagues and friends in other institutions to see what excites them, what issues are they trying to sort out." - Taline Kuyumjian

										"In preparation for a project with Native American artists I've been reading up on indigenous research methodologies. It has been a powerful way of challenging my own experiences and forcing me to rethink my practice. The three books reommended to me were: Research Is Ceremony: Indigenous Research Methods by Shawn Wilson, Indigenous Methodologies: Characteristics, Conversations, and Contexts by Margaret Elizabeth Kovach and Indigenous Research Methodologies by Bagele Chilisa.." - Taline Kuyumjian

										"Stephanie Evergreen and Ann Emery's data visualization blogs are great resources for developing my skill-sets. Museum 2.0, Nina Simon's blog, poses some truly wonderful, deep questions about our purpose and relevance as practitioners. Nonprofits with Balls offers perspective on how nonprofits, despite different missions and functions and products, all grapple with similar issues and can learn from each others' experiences." - Taline Kuyumjian

Current approaches include the use of TBI, and finding ways to write more visually dynamic reports that present data in relevant, accessible ways." - Taline Kuyumjian

										"I more or less stumbled into the field of visitor studies by doing media and educational program evaluations, related to NSF and NASA-funded initiatives, in museum settings. Since then, my museum-based work has expanded to include exhibition evaluation and other forms of visitor studies, but I also continue to do media and ed. program evaluations outside of museums/visitor institutions as well.  My work outside museums informs the work I do in museums and vice versa." - Jennifer Borland

										"I love opportunities to partner with evaluators outside of my organization. I feel that that is one of the best way to see how other practitioners approach the common problems that we face in visitor studies. I also appreciate the constructive feedback and collaborative brainstorming opportunities, plus I can usually pick up some new tips, tricks, or evaluative techniques." - Jennifer Borland

										"There's a lot of great information that gets shared within organizations and institutions every day, but a lot of it gets lost in the shuffle of every day life that comes along afterwards. I think we can do a lot better as a field of organizing our information and making sure that new generations of visitor studies practitioners have easy access to all the wisdom and resources (and the rich history of the field) that has come before them." - Jennifer Borland
